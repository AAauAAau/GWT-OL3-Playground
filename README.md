GWT-OL3-Playground
==================

A Playground for the new OpenLayers3-Wrapper for GWT using the new JSInterop-Features of the GWT-SDK-Sources.

You can build the application with Maven. If you want to use it without please consider the following hints: 

You have to build the latest GWT-SDK from the source:

Building the application with older GWT-SDK (e.g. SDK 2.6.1) will not work.

It is essential to compile the application with compiler args -XjsInteropMode JS.
